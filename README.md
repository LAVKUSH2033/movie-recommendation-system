A movie recommendation system is a technology that suggests movies to users based on their preferences, past viewing history, and behavior. These systems use various algorithms and techniques to analyze large datasets of movies and user interactions to make personalized recommendations.

Typically, movie recommendation systems employ collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches. Collaborative filtering compares users' preferences and behavior to recommend movies that similar users have enjoyed. Content-based filtering suggests movies based on their attributes, such as genre, actors, or director, matching them to a user's known preferences.

Additionally, recommendation systems may incorporate machine learning models to continuously improve recommendations by learning from user feedback and interactions. These systems are widely used by streaming platforms, online movie databases, and e-commerce websites to enhance user experience, increase engagement, and promote content discovery<img width="960" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-05 084754" src="https://github.com/LAVKUSH2033/movie-recommendation-system/assets/161098199/6b01914a-195c-4d7e-876d-a68f0e7613be">
